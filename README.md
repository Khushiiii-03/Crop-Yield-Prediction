**DESCRIPTION**

The Crop Yield Prediction Model is a machine learning-based classification system that recommends the most suitable crop for cultivation based on various environmental factors. It analyzes soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), weather conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall), and pH levels to determine the optimal crop for a given set of conditions.
The model uses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a machine learning algorithm to classify crops based on historical data. Farmers and agricultural experts can use this model to improve decision-making, enhance productivity, and optimize resource utilization.
